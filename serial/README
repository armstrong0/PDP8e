whilst trying to get the receiver working to implement Doug Ingraham's console serial device (csd) I had trouble with the receiver.  There were charactors arrivinging at the USB to TTL convertor yet the PDP8 was not receiving charactors.  I halted the machine, the pressed clear, then deasserted halt and pressed cont inue and the program recovered.  So clear fixed the receiver!  I took out two false start bit detection steps set the baud rate the 115200 and rebuilt.  It works fine now, but I don't see how what I did fixed it!

The PDP8 is operating at 73.5 MHz.  At 115200 that is 738 clocks per baud. 7/16 of a baud is 279 and 1/16 of a baud is 40.

This is different than the existing one, which uses one counter to get to 16 * baud rate, and then works from that.  

so the sketch of a new receiver would be
states idle
    start_check
    start_bit
    bit0
    bit1
    bit2
    bit3 
    bit4
    bit5 
    bit6
    bit7
    stop_bit


cntr <= cntr- 1; / in verilog this may make cntr 0 but it won't be recognized 
                 / until the next clock
if (cntr == 0) begin
  cntr <= full_baud;  // set for a full baud period UNLESS overridden below
  case (state)
  idle:
    cntr <= one_16_baud
    if (rx == 0)
    begin
      state <= check_start
    end
    else state <= idle;
  check_start: 
    if (rx == 1) begin  // false start bit.
    state <=, idle;
    cntr <= one_16_baud;
    end else begin
    state <= start_bit;
    cntr <= seven_16_baud;
    end
  start_bit:
    state <= bit0;
  bit0: begin
  state <= bit1;
  char1 <= {rx,char1[0:6];
  end
  bit1
  ....
     
  stop_bit: begin
    flag <= 1;
    state <= idle;
    end
