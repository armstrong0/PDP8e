tests required to test data break changes to state_machine.
as of now all the changes to the state machine are in F3, D3 and E3 
as well as added data break states.  Data break testing happens at the 
end of each machine cycle.  So we need to test all the possible destinations
of each of the three states above.

F3  :F0  6 and 7 op codes AND JMP D 7200 5000
	:D0  deferred say JMP I 5400
	:E0  TAD D 1000

D3	:F0 JMP I 5400
	:E0 TAD I

E3	:F0 tad D TAD I

then we have the condition where we have an interrupt AND a data break

F3:
D3:
E3:


This should make be made so that each test ends in a halt. 
Note that some tests (op codes) will test multiple cases - JMP I
