verify that op code for memory ops sequence through the proper states - choose
one of DSA ISZ TAD AND     F,E   F,D,E

DCA		o3000  y
DCA I   o3400  y


verify that JMP I and D works properly  F,D F
JMP I   o5400 y
JMP D   o5000 y

verify that JMS I and D work  F,D,E F,E
JMS I   o4400 y
JMS D   o4000 y

verify that single machine cycle ops work
CLA     o7200
ION     o6001
IOF     o6002
HLT     o7402

Single Step asserted and cont does one machine cycle
verify that single step works on 1,2 and 3 MC op and from H0
CLA    o7200 
JMP I  o5400
AND I  o0400


verify that interupt response is correct  from F3, D3 and E3  vectoring to E0
to F0
ADD HLTs to make it easier to control

DCA I o3400
HLT   o7402
DCA D o3000
HLT   o7402
CLA   o7200
HLT   o7402

Halt - Cont executes one complete instruction
verify halt works from F3, D3 and E3

DCA I o3400
DCA D o3000
CLA   o7200

Verify that indirect auto increment works
current page (set the PC to 12'o0010 ) 
Verify timing
These are non auto increment
JMP I 5600   // have to pull another value from memory (or hardcode)
DCA I 3600
HLT 7402

Now using zero page  I 
JMP I 5410
DCA I 3410
hlt 7402
Now current page (PC [0:4] == 0
JMP I 5610
DCA I 3610
hlt
my test bed reads the last op code and the simulation stops before it is done
I could fix it but I think I will just add another opcode 
7402 - just needed a carrage return!!
