Some EAE instructions will complete in the fetch machine cycle
Some EAE instructions will complete in the fetch machine cycle BUT extend it.
Some EAE instructions will complete in the Defered cycle BUT extend it.
Some EAE instructions will require F,D and multiple E cycles.

One could (heavily) modify the state machine to keep track of this OR put
hooks in the state machine to allow another state machine: EAE_state_machine,
to sequence the EAE instructions.  To do this the main state machine needs
slight modification to allow it to relinquish control.  I think the latter
approach is better.

Need to take each instruction and determine which sequence it follows.
