The ICE40up5k is not as fast as the ICE40HX, so the clock frequency has to be lower.  However it does have lots of RAM so it can have the full 32 k words of memory.



One needs to make a pll module with the correct parameters for the operating frequency;

This can be done thus:

 icepll -i 12 -o 58  -f  pll.v -m

 Where 12 is the input clock frequency in MHz and the 58 is the output frequency.

Then the frequency has to be set in the PDP8e.pcf file and parameters.v to provide the tools information on the desired operating frequency.

The file parameters.v, one level up, calculates many things from the clock frequency, such as the number of bits in the debounce timer in front_panel.v and baud rate parameters in the serial module.  So the clock frequency must match what is set in the pcf and pll.  If they are not close enough a warning will show up in one or both of the logs.
