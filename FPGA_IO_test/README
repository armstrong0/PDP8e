This directory contains the source code for a hardware test.  Its intent is to test every LED and every switch as well as the receive and transmit serial lines.

The address LEDs , EMA 0- 2 and address 0 - 11 display and rapidly increasing count.

The run LED is connected to the receive serial line.  Normal state is LED off, when a receive character appears the LED will blink.  There is no processing on this line, so low baud rates the LED may visibly blink, on higher baud rates the intensity of the LED will vary depending upon the character.

A simple serial receiver is implemented. The baud rate is set in the source code,  the received character can be display on the low order (bits 5:11) of the data display by switching the display selector switch to state. Bits 0 and 1 are light if a start bit or stop bit error is found.  Currently on properly formatted PDP8e tapes sent using sendtape framing and or startbit errors occur BUT we know the hardware is OK.

A serial transmitter is implemented, it transmits:
7 bits No parity 2 stops bits 
8 bits 1 stop bit with the 88th bit set to 1.
It transmits the ASCII values for space (h20) through to tilde ~ (h7e) and repeats. A carriage return (h0d) and linefeed (h0a)  are inserted every 80 characters. 

A single 1 bit is shifted across the data display LED's when the status or ac display is selected.
